            <div class="faq-details" id="faq1">
                Outdoor Casual – Embrace the camp vibes with flannels, jeans, and 'classy camping' attire. If you prefer to wear a dress, opt for flowy styles or anything comfortable for the outdoors. Keep in mind that most seating consists of benches, so choose fabrics that won’t snag easily.

            <div class="faq-details" id="faq2">
                We recommend wearing flat shoes or comfortable footwear, as the terrain consists mostly of gravel paths and grassy areas. Stilettos or thin heels may not be ideal for navigating the outdoor setting. Opt for wedges, sandals, or even cute boots that fit the camp vibe!
