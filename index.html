    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Emily first saw Joshua at the NOVA Manassas Campus bookstore, where he worked, and she was working for campus IT. For Emily, it was love at first sight. Nicknamed the "cute bookstore guy" by her family, Joshua unknowingly began to play a special role in her life.</p>
    <p>Emily's first words to Joshua were, "How difficult can I be?" and in that moment, Joshua knew she would be a handful. Yet, it only made him more intrigued by her bold and playful personality.</p>
    <p>During the COVID pandemic, despite masks and work windows separating them, their friendship blossomed. Through funny faces, brief passing conversations, and even shared moments behind the glass, they grew closer.</p>
    <p>Their unique connection led to countless lunch "dates" to the grocery store, late-night snack runs, and notes scribbled on coffee cups. Finally, on January 19th, 2022, Joshua asked Emily out, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
    <p>After talking and dating for over a year, Emily and Joshua took the next big step in their journey, moving in together in late October 2022. Since then, they've filled their home with love—and quite a few furry (and scaly) companions! They've welcomed three cats, Moose, Benny, and Moony, along with two tortoises, Raph (Joshua's first baby) and Peanut, as well as their leopard gecko, Casper.</p>

    <!-- Our FAQ Section -->
    <section id="faqs">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
    <p>Outdoor Casual – embrace the camp vibes with flannels, jeans, and "classy camping" attire. Think rustic elegance and comfy outdoor wear!</p>
    <p><strong>What type of shoes should I wear?</strong></p>
    <p>We recommend wearing flat shoes or comfortable footwear, as the terrain consists mostly of gravel paths and grassy areas. Stilettos or thin heels may not be ideal for navigating the outdoor setting. Opt for wedges, sandals, or even cute boots that fit the camp vibe!</p>
    <p><strong>Are kids allowed?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, kids are welcome at our wedding! We want the celebration to be fun for guests of all ages. There will be activities and plenty of space for the little ones to enjoy themselves. However, if you need a quiet space for naps or downtime, we will do our best to have a designated area available.</p>
    <p><strong>Is everything in the same location?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, all events—including the ceremony, reception, and any additional activities—will be within walking distance of each other at Bull Run Regional Park. For guests who may have difficulty walking longer distances, we will provide transportation assistance, such as utility carts, to ensure everyone can move comfortably between locations.</p>
    <p><strong>How should I RSVP?</strong></p>
    <p>We will be providing more information on how to RSVP as we get closer to the wedding date. Keep an eye out for a formal invitation or on this website. Your timely response is greatly appreciated so we can plan accordingly!</p>
    <p><strong>Will the wedding be indoors or outdoors?</strong></p>
    <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be outdoors, so plan accordingly for weather.</p>
    <p><strong>What happens if it rains?</strong></p>
    <p>We have a covered area for the reception, and the ceremony will take place rain or shine. Pack an umbrella just in case!</p> </section>
